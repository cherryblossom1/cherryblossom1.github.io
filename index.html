                                <p>Dempster-Shafer theory refers to evidence based framework to measure the confidence of a hypothesis. We used this framework in conjunction with fuzzy sets to classify a radar-detected object into 4 types: aircrafts, chaff and clouds, ballistic missiles, and satellites, based on the position, velocity, and acceleration profiles of the tracked object.</p>
                                <li><u>End-to-end radar chain for phased-array architecture using Simulink</u></li>
                                <p>An end-to-end radar chain refers to the whole radar system starting from waveform generation to detection and signal processing. I developed this fully using Simulink blocks, which provides fundamental RF and DSP blocks. The whole chain is generated programatically using MATLAB, and is funnly reconfigurable. This was then used to verify some results previosly simulated.</p>

                                <li><u>Internship at Sibridge-Technologies</u></li>
                                <p>
                                Sibridge-Technologies at that time was developing a Linked-List-DMA device, for which we interns were supposed to write test cases. We created the whole test-bench using system verilog that interacted with the available FPGA architecture. The test bench was created using basic modules such that any type of test-case was possible to generate with minimal configuration.

                                <li><u>Interactive painting using gestures on pandaboard with kinect sensor</u></li>
                                <p>
                                For the purpose of creating a system to enable more effective classroom learning, we developed a Kinect sensor based interactive painting system using hand gestures. The Kinect sensor was interfaced with pandaboard (SBC) to keep the system as plug-n-play. Pandaboard was equipped with python and OpenCV modules, which were used for image processing and gesture recognition. The final ‘painting’ would be then displayed on whichever display is connected to the pandaboard.

                                As a part of course project, we developed a virtual synthesiser, that produced tones using PC keyboard. The UI and signal processing both were done using MATLAB.

                                <p>
                                As a part of course project, we developed a MATLAB based audio player. This player could display a dense frequency spectrum, could alter the sampling frequency and speed, and apply basic filter based denoising.

                                To build a device to help blind people recognise keys on a touchpad, we designed a bluetooth controlled glove with actuators. We used small DC motors to actuate vibration on each finger. We designed a simple scheme to recognize the buttons for a synthetic app. The bluetooth transceiver and motors were controlled using a microcontroller, which could receive commands from cellphone application.

                                We designed and fabricated a ‘slot’ antenna and analysed various parameters like radiation pattern, scattering loss, etc. using VNA.
